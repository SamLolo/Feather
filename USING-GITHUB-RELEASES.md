# How to install the modpack using Github Releases
This is a tutorial for how to **manually install** the modpack to the Minecraft Launcher! This will require you to install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), and then add the mods yourself manually, so if you're not too sure on how to naviagate your computers filesystem, it is recommended that you install the modpack from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/feather-client) using their [launcher](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) for a one-click install and easier upgrade. You will also need to **follow the second half of this installation process each time you want to upgrade** the modpack!
