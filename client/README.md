# Client Files
The 2 folders are Packwiz format saves of the modpack. These can be used to update and alter the modpack if you know what you're doing. If you'd like to learn more about Packwiz as a tool, you can visit their [github](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)!
*Please note: we will not be able to provide support for those trying to update the pack themselves. If you don't know what you're doing, it's best to wait for the official releases on Curseforge and Modrinth!*

## Curseforge
The packwiz files in this folder are configured to use curseforge as a source where possible! The mods used here will be the same as those found in the curseforge version of the pack, hence why it is suggested to use the modrinth version as this has the full range of available mods!

## Modrinth
The packwiz files in this folder use modrinth as an update source. This is **preferred** as many mod creators are moving towards modrinth, meaning there is less support and updates to mods published on curseforge. The modrinth version of the pack also contains some exclusive mods that aren't allowed to be published in curseforge modpacks!
