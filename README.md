## How To Use The Repository
The files for each minecraft version are contained in their own branch respectively. This branch "*latest*" will always be the highest minecraft version supported, which is currently **1.20.1**. The modpacks are stored using [Packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz), which is a command-line based tool used for managing modpacks. If you plan to update or alter the modpack yourself, you should familarise yourself with their [wiki](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/creating/getting-started/) first!

For each minecraft version, you should see the following files:
- [Client](Client/)
  - Contains the curseforge and modrinth packwiz folders for the modpack
    - *For more info on which packwiz to use, have a read of [this](Client/README.md)!*
- [Server](Server/) **(Coming Soon!)**
  - Contains the packwiz folders used for creating the supporting server files. Similar format to the client folder!
- [Scripts](Scripts/)
  - Contains a collection of tools and scripts written to help with managing the modpack

Releases on GitHub are designed for those that want to use the modpack with the Minecraft Launcher or want to get a download with all the mod jars inside! These are useful if you want to add to the pack yourself but don't want to use the packwiz versions! Details on how to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/SamLolo/Feather/tree/latest/USING-GITHUB-RELEASES.md)!
