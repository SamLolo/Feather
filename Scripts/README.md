# Helper Scripts & Tools
**Note: This is currently empty, however I plan to add to this as the project progresses!**

Here you will find any helper scripts and tools used when creating the modpack!

Please note, I will not be providing any support for using these scripts! They are mostly here for those that are familiar with python and the technical side of creating modpacks, and should only be used if you know what you are doing!

*If you would like to contribute your own scripts, open a [pull request](https://github.com/SamLolo/Feather/pulls)!*
